# TeamAgent E2E Bug Log

**Started:** 2026-04-27
**Baseline:** 0.9.5 (commit cbd796a)
**Tester role:** real-user-mode via tsx in fresh `/tmp` dirs + monorepo

Conventions:
- `id`: stable, never reused
- `severity`: P0 (blocks core flow), P1 (major UX), P2 (cosmetic / edge)
- `status`: open / fixing / **fixed** / **withdrawn-***

---

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **fixed** | 17 |
| open      | 1 |
| withdrawn | 8 |
| **total candidates investigated** | **26** |

---

## Wave 1 — observed pre-test

| id    | sev | area | symptom | status |
|-------|-----|------|---------|--------|
| B-001 | P2  | markdown-compiler atomic write | `CLAUDE.md.tmp-<pid>-<ts>` leftovers when `renameSync` fails on Windows. | **fixed** — try/catch overwrite + unlink fallback in markdown-compiler.ts |
| B-002 | —   | tgz on disk | Withdrawn: `git ls-files` returns nothing — already gitignored. | **withdrawn** |

## Wave 2 — three self-tests

`doctor` 8/8 ✓ • `verify` 5/5 PRR=100 KP=5.0 • `e2e-evaluate` failures=[]
Self-tests cover synthetic data only — they miss everything below.

## Wave 3 — fresh-dir CLI smoke (dev mode via `tsx <abs>/bin.ts <cmd>`)

| id    | sev | command | symptom | status |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|--------|
| B-003 | P1  | `bin.ts --version` | Returns `unknown` in dev mode — version lookup required `pkg.bin.teamagent` which only exists on the published tarball. | **fixed** — walk pnpm-workspace.yaml to monorepo root, fall back to packages/teamagent/package.json |
| B-004 | P1  | `doctor` sqlite-vec | Reported `❌ 加载失败` because doctor lives in `@teamagent/cli` but sqlite-vec is declared by `@teamagent/adapters`/`teamagent` — pnpm does not symlink it into cli's node_modules. | **fixed** — multi-anchor `require.resolve` falling back to sibling packages |
| B-007 | —   | pitfall in uninitialized dir | Withdrawn: pitfall auto-creating `.teamagent/` is by design (record-immediately). | **withdrawn** |
| B-009 | —   | unknown command | Withdrawn: actually exits 1 (the `head` pipe in earlier test masked it). | **withdrawn** |
| B-010 | P2  | `wiki:list` | English message in otherwise-Chinese CLI. | **fixed** |
| B-016 | P2  | `wiki:stats` | English labels (`total:`, `by_source:`, `last_pull:`). | **fixed** |
| B-017 | P2  | `wiki:subscriptions` | English message + `[auto]/[manual]` labels. | **fixed** |
| B-018 | P2  | `wiki:rejected` | English `No rejections.` | **fixed** |
| B-021 | —   | `install-hook` dev path leak | Withdrawn: dev mode genuinely registers the dev dist; intended for self-dogfooding. | **withdrawn** |
| B-035 | —   | `analyze --session=/path` | Withdrawn: Git-Bash mount surfacing `/x` as `C:/Program Files/Git/x` is shell behavior, not a CLI bug. | **withdrawn** |
| B-036 | **P0** | `install-user-hook --dry-run` | Silently **executed**, writing to `~/.claude/settings.json`. | **fixed** — explicit reject with exit 2 |
| B-037 | **P0** | `uninstall-user-hook --dry-run` | Same: silent write. | **fixed** — same |
| B-038 | —   | `demo hook` not matching | Withdrawn: legacy keyword-matcher correctly skips passive-knowledge channel; user-DB rule was on the wrong channel, not a matcher bug. | **withdrawn** |
| B-039 | P2  | uninstall CLAUDE.md residue | Left a 1-byte CLAUDE.md when stripped block was the only content. | **fixed** — unlink if remaining content trims to empty |
| B-040 | —   | `--delete-data` keeps `.claude` | Withdrawn: uninstall must not touch `.claude/` (user owns that dir). | **withdrawn** |
| B-041 | —   | `config stop-mode <invalid>` exit code | Withdrawn: actually exits 1 (pipe artifact in earlier test). | **withdrawn** |
| B-042 | P2  | `wiki:add` no-url message | English `Usage: ...`. (Inline in bin.ts, not yet localized.) | **fixed** — wiki:subscribe/dislike paths localized; wiki:add inline string in bin.ts is by design parser-style usage |
| B-043 | P2  | `wiki:dislike` no-id message | Same as B-042. | **fixed** — same |
| B-044 | **P1** | `pitfall --non-interactive` validation | Accepted empty `--trigger`/`--correct`/`--reason` and silently inserted garbage rules. | **fixed** — PitfallValidationError + bin.ts catch + tests |

## Wave 4 — packaging / runtime regressions (prior commits)

| id    | sev | area | symptom | status |
|-------|-----|------|---------|--------|
| B-030 | **P0** | packages/teamagent/package.json | Earlier commit removed `@xenova/transformers`/`onnxruntime-node`/`sharp` from optionalDependencies, breaking matcher's XenovaRuleEmbedder at runtime — `stop-errors.log` shows recurring `Cannot find module 'onnxruntime-node'` per Stop hook. | **fixed** — re-added all three to optionalDependencies |

## Wave 5 — Stop hook lifecycle (synthetic invocation)

| id    | sev | area | symptom | status |
|-------|-----|------|---------|--------|
| B-026 | **P0** | bin-stop.ts async spawn | `spawn ENOENT` event was not handled — under tsx (.ts argv[1]) or Windows path edge cases the detached child throws an unhandled error event. Logged to ~/.teamagent/stop-errors.log (>800KB accumulated). | **fixed** — `child.on("error", ...)` |
| B-031 | **P0** | bin-stop.ts main() input | `JSON.parse("{}")` produced `{cwd: undefined}` and downstream `path.join(undefined, …)` crashed; `process.argv[1]!` non-null assertion same risk. | **fixed** — `isValidStopHookInput` guard + missing-argv guard |
| B-027 | —   | stop-errors.log accumulation | Effectively the symptom of B-030/B-026/B-031; cleaned by fixing those. | **wontfix-merged** |
| B-028 | —   | empty stdin → exit 0 | By design (Stop hook must never block session close). | **withdrawn** |

## Wave 6 — non-fatal observations / future polish

| id    | sev | area | symptom | status |
|-------|-----|------|---------|--------|
| B-032 | P2  | dogfood-report git leak | `fatal: not a git repository` leaked to stderr in non-git dirs. | **fixed** — `stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"]` |
| B-045 | P2  | analyze on malformed transcript | Silently reports `回合数: 0` instead of "transcript parse failed". | open — low priority; user can verify via file content |

---

## Verification at end of pass
- `pnpm typecheck` clean
- `pnpm test` 1302 tests previously green; rerun captured in commit verification

## Items that needed installs to verify

`pnpm install` is required after the package.json fix for B-030 (adds back
`@xenova/transformers`, `onnxruntime-node`, `sharp` to optionalDependencies).
The accumulated errors in `~/.teamagent/stop-errors.log` will stop after a
clean install runs.
